#### About DeXTER (DeepTextMiner)

DeXTER is an app that visualises the referential entities (i.e., place names, people, organisations) in *ChroniclItaly 3.0* [(Viola and Fiscarelli 2021)](10.5281/zenodo.4596344), an open access corpus of Italian immigrant newspapers previously tagged for entities using a sequence tagging tool [(Riedl and Padó 2018)](https://github.com/riedlma/sequence_tagging) and enriched with deep learning techniques. The app allows users to explore references to place names (e.g., city, region, and/or country) on a map, as well as their distribution and co-relations (i.e., co-occurrence, sentiment polarity) with the other entities across titles, issues, and over time by selecting a wide range of filters, as follows:

-	Time: from 1898 to 1936;
-	Newspaper’s title;
-	Type of frequency visualization: absolute, percentage;
-	Geographical information: include/exclude references to cities/regions;
-	Percentile: select the least/most mentioned entity;
-	Entity information: include/exclude specific entities;
-	Sentiment information: select polarity, sentence co-occurrence frequency, top entities, over time trend;
-	Network information: ego-network and issue network;
-	Choose the map: 1880, 1914, 1920, 1994.

Users can also share their results, download the raw data which may reflect their filters’ selection, and download the visualisations as .png files.

In order to reflect the changing geo-political borders within the analysed period (1898-1920), users can additionally choose between three historical world maps displaying the different borders at three crucial points: 1880, 1914, 1920. By default, DeXTER displays a contemporary (1994) world map.

The full step-by-step documentation of the project, including the source code of this app, is available on GitHub at this [link](https://github.com/lorellav/DeXTER-DeepTextMiner).

DeXTER has been created as an exploratory, visualisation tool to assist researchers of cultural heritage to navigate large quantities of contextually enriched digital material.
