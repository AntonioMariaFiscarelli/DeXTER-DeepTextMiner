In the co-occurrence network, each edge displays a weight indicating the sentiment (or average score of) of the sentence(s) in which the two entities (i.e., nodes) co-occur.
This weight ranges from -1 to 1, where values close to -1 indicate a negative sentiment and values close to 1 indicate a positive sentiment.
