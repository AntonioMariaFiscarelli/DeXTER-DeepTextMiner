This visualization shows the ego network of the selected entity. The ego network of an actor (i.e., entity) consists of a focal node (ego) and of all the other nodes that are directly connected to it (alters).
By selecting "Ego only", the visualization will show only the edges between ego and alters. Otherwise, all edges between any two alters in the network will be shown.
