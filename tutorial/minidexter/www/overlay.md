By default, DeXTER shows a contemporary world map (1994). To reflect the changing geo-political borders and give users a more accurate visualization of the results, three additional historical world maps have been added at three crucial points within the analysed period (1898-1920): 1880, 1914, 1920. Depending on individual research questions, users can choose any of the four maps to visualize references to place names.
